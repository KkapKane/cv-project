# Things I learned from this Project

* Found out what states and props are
* Its important to create components that can be reused
* Those small icons in your tab are called favicon
* Use custom hooks that other people have made to make your job easier
```bash
npm install react-hook-form
```
```js
import { useForm } from 'react-hook-form';
```
* Map method finally clicked while working on this project
